The constructs required for the project are discussed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ooCMhXHBoz_SRve0uTH5VF4Y94habUld/view). The interpreter must be able to analyze each line of the program lexically, syntactically, and semantically.

## Instructions

You are required to submit the following for the project:
    1. A .zip file (filename: <GroupName>_<section>.zip) which should contain the following:
        a. a text file (filename: contributors.txt) that contains the name of all contributing groupmates;
        b. a folder (filename: source code) that contains all the necessary files needed to run your project; and
        c. a Readme.md file that contains the instructions on how to run your project. This includes the 
        necessary dependencies, along with the instructions on how to install them.
    2. Submit your peer evaluation.
